  The satellite model proposed to regulate is a simplified form of the family of satellites used by NASA, within the mission GRACE-FO. The transfer function from the voltage applied to the inertial wheels present on the satellite at its pitch angle (which needs to be adjusted), is:
  
P(s) = 10/(s(100s + 1)(0.1s + 1))

  The objectives are the following:
1. presentation of the nominal model for a monitoring satellite and analysis characteristics from a systemic point of view;
2. the transposition of the performance requirements, regarding the monitoring of the geophysical phenomena in frequency weights used to obtain a law of command;
3. analysis of sources of uncertainty within the model and limitations imposed on them in the design phase;
4. ensuring satisfactory indicators of robustness and safe operation of the satellite during monitoring maneuvers;
5. rigorous validation of the results obtained;
6. carrying out a detailed discussion, regarding the compromise obtained
